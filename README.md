# color-palette

**Reason for Development:** 

When I was dealing with web programming, I was obsessed with modern interfaces because the code I wrote in the background was integrated with the interface and the value of the project was understood.

While designing, I was constantly trying to find compatible colors, then I came up with this project idea and coded it.

**Example**
